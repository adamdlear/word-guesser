# Word Guesser

## Motivation
This project was inspired by the moment when someone doesn't know what word they are trying to say or write, but they can describe it with no issues. I wanted to develop an application that takes this user description and predicts what word the person is reaching for.

## Methods
This project had multiple iterations, each trying to improve the prediction accuracy but using different methods. 

### Attempt 1: Sequence Matching

### Attempt 2: Text Classification

### Attempt 3: Embeddings and Cosine Similarity
